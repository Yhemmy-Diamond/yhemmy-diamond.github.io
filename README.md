![Dashboard](/assets/bank_loanb.png) 

#### Project Description
The project involves developing an interactive dashboard to analyze the performance of bank loans. It provides insights into loan applications, funded amounts, and repayment statuses. The dashboard categorizes loans into "Good Loans" and "Bad Loans" based on repayment behavior and highlights key metrics such as the total funded amount, loan applications, and interest rates. It is designed to help management monitor loan health, detect trends, and improve decision-making.\
**Technology:** Microsoft Excel


#### North Star Metric
Total Funded Amount Received: $473.1M

#### KPIs
- Good Loan Ratio
- Bad Loan Ratio
- Total Loan Applications
- Total Funded Amount
- Interest Rates
- Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)
- Loan Status Breakdown

#### Summary of Insights
The following are the insights gotten from the analysis: 
1. The majority of loans (86.2%) are classified as "Good Loans," contributing significantly to the total funded amount received ($435.8M).
2. A smaller portion (13.8%) are "Bad Loans," with a funded amount of $65.5M, of which $37.3M has been received.
3. Loans with lower interest rates (11.6%) are predominantly fully paid, indicating a correlation between interest rates and repayment success.
4. The "Debt Consolidation" and "Credit Card" loan purposes likely dominate the portfolio (inferred from their prominence in typical dashboards).
5. Monitoring the DTI and optimizing the balance between interest rates and approval criteria could further improve loan recovery rates and minimize defaults.

#### Recommendations
Based on the insights derived from the Bank Loan Report, here are actionable recommendations for the bank to enhance its performance, improve customer satisfaction, and reduce risks: 
1. Optimize Loan Products
- Adjust Loan Terms:
Since the majority of borrowers prefer 36-month loans, the bank should offer more flexible repayment options for this term, such as lower interest rates or additional perks.

2. Tailor Loans to Employment Profiles:

- Applicants with over 10 years of employment are a significant group. Offering loyalty rewards, premium loan packages, or preferential interest rates for this category could boost retention.
- For borrowers with shorter employment tenures (1–2 years), implement stricter risk assessment measures and provide smaller loan amounts to reduce default risks... [Link to read more](https://github.com/Yhemmy-Diamond/bank-loans-report) \
